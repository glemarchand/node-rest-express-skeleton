# Skeleton

## Introduction

I was tired of always doing the same stuff and losing time to write it.
So I made this small skeleton.

Folder structure :
* _lib_ contains back objects definitions
* _public_ contains front elements
* _index.js_ is the main process

## How to use

* Contains a REST API
* serve static files
* commands :
    * npm install
    * npm start

## Licence

Beerware :)
